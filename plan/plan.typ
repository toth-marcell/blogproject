= Function
Users can register or log in and publish posts.
The website's frontpage shows all posts.
Each post can also be viewed separately by clicking on its title, and the author's profile can be viewed by clicking on their name.

Creating a post requires the user to log in first, since each post has an author. Other functions (like reading posts) can be done without an account.
= Web and desktop
The desktop program has only basic features (view and create posts), while the website features the admin page, the ability to view a user's profile and more.
There is a backend which exposes an HTTP API and connects to the database.
