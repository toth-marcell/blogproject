    columns: 2,
    gutter: 5cm,
    table(
      text(weight: "bold", "User"),
      [id #pin("userId")],
      "name",
      "password",
      "isAdmin"
    ),
    table(
      text(weight: "bold", "Post"),
      "id",
      "title",
      "text",
      [#pinit-arrow(0,"userId", start-dy: 5pt, end-dy: -3pt)#pin(0)UserId],
    ),
  )
]
== Authentication
- user password are hashed twice
  - once with sha256 to limit length (bcrypt has a max input size)
  - once with bcrypt (salted)
- JWT for sessions
  - website sends the token as a cookie
  - API sends it in the body, so the desktop program can handle storing it
